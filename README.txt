
The package contains idCard.js JavaScript library for signing in web browsers and a sample application sign-*.html which demonstrates how the library can be used. 

The library enables integrating signature creation functionality to web applications - the signer's token (ID-card or other token) can be accessed via the browser environment. 
The library uses "digidocPlugin" browser plug-in to communicate with the token. More information is available in the documentation.
