I'm only making idcard.js awesomness available to bower users.

$bower install js-token-signing

And here is the official readme.
----
The package contains idCard.js JavaScript library for signing in web browsers and a sample application sign.html which demonstrates how the library can be used. 

The library enables integrating signature creation functionality to web applications - the signer's token (ID-card or other token) can be accessed via the browser environment. 
The library uses browser signing module to communicate with the token. More information is available in the documentation.
