# hwcrypto.js
> Browser JavaScript interface for signing with hardware tokens

* [![Bower version](https://badge.fury.io/bo/hwcrypto.svg)](http://bower.io/search/?q=hwcrypto)
* [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/open-eid/hwcrypto.js.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/open-eid/hwcrypto.js)


## Get started

The easiest way for managing JavaScript-s on a website is with [Bower](http://bower.io/):

        $ bower install --save hwcrypto

Alternatively you can download the files from [release area](https://github.com/open-eid/hwcrypto.js/releases).

`hwcrypto.js` itself does not do much, it depends on trusted platform code (installed separately and often running outside of the browser) to do the heavy lifting. 

## Features

Version 0.0.7 has built-in support for:
- [NPAPI style synchronous plugins for Firefox, Safari and IE](https://github.com/open-eid/browser-token-signing)
- [Chrome messaging extension](https://github.com/open-eid/chrome-token-signing)

Supports all [latest browsers](http://browsehappy.com/):
- Chrome 40+
- Firefox
- IE 11
- Safari

Support for IE8+ is achieved by polyfilling Promises, EventListener and TypedArray.

Distribution and installation of the necessary platform components is out of scope of this project.

For further instructions on how to use the interface please have a look at [API specification](https://github.com/open-eid/hwcrypto.js/wiki/ModernAPI)
